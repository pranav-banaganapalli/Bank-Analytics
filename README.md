# Bank-Loan-Analytics (Excel | Power BI | Tableau)

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **bank loan analytics solution** built using **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**.  
The objective is to convert raw loan transaction data into **interactive dashboards** that help banks analyze loan performance, borrower behavior, and risk indicators.

## Problem Statement
The bank maintained loan data in large Excel files without meaningful visualization, resulting in:
- Manual and time-consuming analysis
- Difficulty identifying loan trends and risk patterns
- Limited visibility into borrower repayment behavior
- No interactive reporting for decision-makers

A centralized and interactive analytics solution was required.

## Solution
- Cleaned and preprocessed large loan datasets (39k+ records per file)
- Designed KPIs aligned with banking and credit-risk analysis
- Built dashboards using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau to compare insights across BI tools
- Enabled trend, geographic, and borrower-level analysis
